I want to build a desktop app to monitor user's keyboard and mouse activity. the logic is as bellow :

when the app starts it tracks user's mouse and keyboard activity. the total activity time is the user's 
usetime of keyboard + user's usetime of mouse. when this activity reachs to 2 hour, it shows a notification
 window on right bellow of the screen and showes a .gif animation of a person doing a simple execrise and says "زمان یک نرمش کوتاه فرا رسیده است".
the user has 2 options either let the notification be on the page or close the notification: if he decided that notification to be open, 
this notification should be closed 30 seconds after and then the application should starts it's loop again(monitorize the user's keyboard 
and mouse activity until it reachs to 2 hours and etc) or the user decides to close the notification. for this matter a counter should count
 how many times user did close the notification and when it reachs to 4 times, a new notification should fires up with a title 
"شما 3 بار پنجره نرمش کردن را بستید،لطفا سعی کنید نرمش را رعایت کنید" with the .gif on it but the user could not close the notification untill 10 seconds
(this notification should be on the buttom right of the screen as well). at the end I want to have total user's usetime of keyboard and mouse 
seperatelly aswell. I want this application to run on windows os
